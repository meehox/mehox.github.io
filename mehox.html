            of the term is often extended to the whole period 1600–1750 without qualifying restrictions, or improperly
            to mean a florid and elaborate style in art, architecture, music or literature, of any date from late

            alt="Romanticism" class="Romantiscism">
        <p class="Romantiscism">At the end of the 18th century and well into the 19th, Romanticism quickly spread
            throughout Europe and the United States to challenge the rational ideal held so tightly during the
            Enlightenment. The artists emphasized that sense and emotions - not simply reason and order - were equally
            important means of understanding and experiencing the world. Romanticism celebrated the individual
            imagination and intuition in the enduring search for individual rights and liberty. Its ideals of the
            creative, subjective powers of the artist fueled avant-garde movements well into the 20th century.
            Romanticist practitioners found their voices across all genres, including literature, music, art, and
            architecture. Reacting against the sober style of Neoclassicism preferred by most countries' academies, the
            far reaching international movement valued originality, inspiration, and imagination, thus promoting a
            variety of styles within the movement. Additionally, in an effort to stem the tide of increasing
            industrialization, many of the Romanticists emphasized the individual's connection to nature and an
            idealized past.</p>

        <p class="impressionism">Term generally applied to a movement in art in France in the late 19th century. The
            movement gave rise to such ancillaries as American Impressionism. The primary use of the term Impressionist
            is for a group of French painters who worked between around 1860 and 1900, especially to describe their
            works of the later 1860s to mid-1880s. These artists include Frédéric Bazille, Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas,
            Edouard Manet, Claude Monet, Berthe Morisot, Camille Pissarro, Auguste Renoir and Alfred Sisley, as well as
            Mary Cassatt, Gustave Caillebotte (who was also an important early collector), Eva Gonzalès, Armand
            Guillaumin and Stanislas Lépine. The movement was anti-academic in its formal aspects and involved the
            establishment of venues other than the official Salon for showing and selling paintings.</p>

            alt="" class="Expressionism">
        <p class="Expressionism">International movement in art and architecture, which flourished between c. 1905 and c.
            1920, especially in Germany. It also extended to literature, music, dance and theatre. The term was
            originally applied more widely to various avant-garde movements: for example it was adopted as an
            alternative to the use of ‘Post-Impressionism’ by Roger Fry in exhibitions in London in 1910 and 1912. It
            was also used contemporaneously in Scandinavia and Germany, being gradually confined to the specific groups
            of artists and architects to which it is now applied. Expressionism in the fine arts developed from the
            Symbolist and expressive trends in European art at the end of the 19th century. The period of ‘classical
            Expressionism’ began in 1905, with the foundation of the group Die Brucke, and ended c. 1920. Although in
            part an artistic reaction both to academic art and to Impressionism, the movement should be understood as a
            form of ‘new Humanism’, which sought to communicate man’s spiritual life. It reflected the deep intellectual
            unrest c. 1900, reflected in contemporary literary sources, about the destruction of the traditional
            relationship of trust between man and the world.</p>

        <p class="surreal">International intellectual movement, which was centred mainly in Paris and occupied with the
            problems of thought and expression in all their forms. The Surrealists perceived a deep crisis in Western
            culture and responded with a revision of values at every level, inspired by the psychoanalytical discoveries
            of Freud and the political ideology of Marxism. In both poetry and the visual arts this revision was
            undertaken through the development of unconventional techniques, of which Automatism was paramount. The
            Parisian poets who formulated Surrealist theory and orientation were officially identified by André Breton’s
            Manifeste du surréalisme (1924), the essay ‘Une Vague de rêves’ (October 1924) by Louis Aragon and the
            periodical La Révolution surréaliste, published two months later. Under Breton’s guidance, the movement
            remained potent up to World War II, surviving until his death in 1966.</p>

        <p class="pop">International movement in painting, sculpture and printmaking. The term originated in the
            mid-1950s at the ICA, London, in the discussions held by the Independent Group concerning the artefacts of
            popular culture. This small group included the artists Richard Hamilton and Eduardo Paolozzi as well as
            architects and critics. Lawrence Alloway (1926–1990), the critic who first used the term in print in 1958,
            conceived of Pop art as the lower end of a popular-art to fine-art continuum, encompassing such forms as
            advertising, science-fiction illustration and automobile styling. Hamilton defined Pop in 1957 as: ‘Popular
            (designed for a mass audience); Transient (short term solution); Expendable (easily forgotten); Low Cost;
            Mass Produced; Young (aimed at Youth); Witty; Sexy; Gimmicky; Glamorous; and Big Business’. Hamilton set
            out, in paintings such as $he (1958–61; London, Tate), to explore the hidden connotations of imagery taken
            directly from advertising and popular culture, making reference in the same work to pin-ups and domestic
            appliances as a means of commenting on the covert eroticism of much advertising presentation.</pclass="pop">
